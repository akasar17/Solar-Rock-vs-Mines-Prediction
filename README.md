Project: Sonar Rock vs. Mines Prediction Machine Learning Model
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine using a logistic regression algorithm. The Sonar dataset, containing 208 samples of sonar signals with 60 features each, is loaded and processed. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, ensuring a balanced distribution of the target classes. The logistic regression model is trained on the training set and evaluated for accuracy. The project also includes an example of predicting the class of a new sonar signal, determining whether the object is a rock or a mine based on the model's output.
